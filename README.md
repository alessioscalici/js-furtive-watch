# js-furtive-watch
## (work in progress)

A watch library for Javascript. It allows to listen to:

* Object property changes
* Method calls
* Array elements properties change

The observed objects are modified minimally, allowing a transparent use (properties and methods are preserved).
At the moments it has browser support only.

Requires ECMAscript 5 support (Object.defineProperty, Object.keys, Object.prototype.isPropertyEnumerable)

**it's still in progress, use it at your own risk**
